      <p class="fs-5">
        <strong>Student Cost Forecast</strong> is a web-based tool designed to help Nigerian undergraduates estimate their annual cost of living based on real student data and predictive modeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        It uses a trained machine learning model (Linear Regression) that considers factors like gender, lifestyle, accommodation type, income sources, and financial aid to produce accurate predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform is ideal for students, parents, education planners, and school administrators who want a data-driven understanding of student financial needs.
